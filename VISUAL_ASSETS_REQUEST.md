## 3. Hero Backgrounds

### A. Cyberpunk SF Skyline (Night)
- **Description:** An atmospheric, futuristic view of the San Francisco skyline at night.

### B. Feldman's Fyre Luxury Tent (Parody)
- **Description:** A satirical take on "luxury" festival accommodations.
- **Visual Elements:** A basic, slightly sad-looking white disaster-relief tent but presented with "luxury" marketing filters (golden hour light, expensive champagne on a plastic table).

**Prompt Suggestion:**
> A satirical "luxury" festival tent in the middle of a barren, dusty lot. A simple white emergency shelter tent is styled like a glamping ad.

Professional travel photography style, shallow depth of field, bright and airy but clearly a parody of the Fyre Festival aesthetic.
